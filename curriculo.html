                <h3>CTO/Software Architecture - GuBee (July 2019 - Present)</h3>
                <p>
                    I led the design and development of an integration hub system bridging e-commerce platforms and marketplaces. The development approach was centered on microservices architecture, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Hexagonal Architecture, and Test-Driven Development (TDD), leveraging Java 21 and Kotlin as primary programming languages, along with Spring Boot and Quarkus in a microservices stack. Our technology stack also includes Apache Kafka for event-driven messaging, as well as Redis and MongoDB for data management. Currently, we're in the process of transitioning to Quarkus with a native framework and deployment setup. Our infrastructure is hosted on AWS, utilizing Kubernetes and AWS Lambda for deployment orchestration. Additionally, I'm responsible for mentoring a young team, overseeing backlog management, and driving product activities

                <h3>System Architect - Atos (December 2014 - July 2019)</h3>
                <p>
                    I've undertaken systems architecture and development projects for prominent clients including NET, Multiplus Fidelidade, and Carrefour. My responsibilities encompass system definition and development, crafting technical and commercial proposals, leading teams, and advocating for our solutions in proposal defenses. I actively engage with Oracle SOA Suite middleware, specializing in crafting OSB, BPEL, and BPM interfaces. Utilizing best practices like VETO for OSB and EAI (Enterprise Integration Pattern), I ensure seamless system integration. Notably, I spearheaded the product definition for Carrefour's HeavyGoods, focusing on enhancing usability and driving sales conversion through tool-driven, event-based microservices.

                <p>
                    As a project leader and software architect, I managed development responsibilities and led projects within the ACEC platform for e-commerce, serving major clients such as Carrefour Group, Decathlon, and Lança Perfume. These projects were built upon a service-oriented architecture, comprising distinct layers: administrative, sales, and integration with ERP and legacy systems. The administrative layer, developed using ADF as the primary framework, facilitated deal management, customer registration, and product maintenance. Meanwhile, the sales layer leveraged Rests, JSF, and Lucene index (Solr) for optimization and research, with a rules engine powered by Drools to manage dynamic rule generation. Additionally, the integration layer, built using BPEL and OSB services, handled data exchange between the platform and customers' ERPs
